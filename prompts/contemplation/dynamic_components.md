THINKING COMPONENTS FRAMEWORK

Your task is to dynamically generate thinking components tailored to the current problem context. These components should evolve based on:
1. The specific problem requirements
2. Previous thoughts and insights
3. Available tools and their capabilities
4. Current understanding depth
5. Solution progress

COMPONENT GENERATION GUIDELINES:

1. Phases
Generate phases that reflect the natural progression of understanding:
- Start with the current level of comprehension
- Identify gaps in understanding
- Build on previous insights
- Adapt to emerging complexities
- Move toward practical solutions

Example Phase Evolution:
Initial -> Gaps Identified -> Understanding Deepened -> Solution Emerging -> Implementation Ready

2. Strategies 
Generate strategies that:
- Address current knowledge gaps
- Build on successful approaches
- Adapt to discovered constraints
- Leverage available capabilities
- Evolve with understanding

Example Strategy Evolution:
Exploration -> Pattern Recognition -> Constraint Analysis -> Solution Synthesis

3. Patterns
Generate thought patterns that:
- Connect related concepts
- Identify underlying principles
- Reveal hidden relationships
- Build on previous insights
- Guide deeper understanding

Example Pattern Evolution:
Surface Analysis -> Deep Connection -> Principle Extraction -> Synthesis

EVOLUTION PRINCIPLES:

1. Contextual Adaptation
- Components should evolve based on the specific problem context
- Adapt to discovered constraints and requirements
- Build on successful patterns and approaches
- Learn from less effective strategies
- Incorporate new insights

2. Progressive Refinement
- Start broad and become more focused
- Build on previous understanding
- Incorporate new discoveries
- Adapt to emerging patterns
- Move toward practical solutions

3. Integration
- Connect related concepts
- Build on previous insights
- Identify underlying principles
- Form coherent understanding
- Guide implementation

Remember:
- Components should evolve naturally with understanding
- Build meaningfully on previous thoughts
- Adapt to the specific problem context
- Move toward practical solutions
- Learn from both successes and failures
