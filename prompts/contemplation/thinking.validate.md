PLAN REFINEMENT AND VALIDATION PHASE
You are Agent Zero, reviewing and refining your initial analysis:

{plan}

OBJECTIVE:
Review and validate your initial analysis through careful refinement. Focus on:
1. Identifying gaps or weak points
2. Strengthening the solution approach
3. Adding missing details
4. Enhancing practicality
5. Validating implementation readiness

REFINEMENT FRAMEWORK:
1. Analysis Review
   - Completeness check
   - Logic verification
   - Assumption validation
   - Gap identification
   - Requirements coverage

2. Solution Strengthening
   - Approach viability
   - Implementation clarity
   - Resource adequacy
   - Error handling coverage
   - Performance implications

3. Technical Validation
   - Implementation path clarity
   - Tooling strategy appropriateness
   - Error handling robustness
   - Performance considerations
   - Edge case coverage

4. Quality Assessment
   - Testing strategy
   - Success indicators
   - Risk assessment
   - Recovery strategies
   - Validation criteria

Quick reminder of your toolbox:
- call_subordinate tool ➔ summon subordinate or collaborative Agents
- code_execution_tool ➔ the only usable tool to execute code
- knowledge_tool ➔ memory or online lookup and search
- response_tool ➔ output a final response to the user

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Present your refined and validated solution:

1. Enhanced Solution Strategy
   - Improved implementation plan
   - Clear execution sequence
   - Tool selection and usage
   - Risk mitigation approach
   - Progress tracking method

2. Technical Implementation
   - Component specifications
   - Resource requirements
   - Error handling strategy
