THOUGHT ITERATION FRAMEWORK

ITERATION PRINCIPLES:

1. Build on Previous Thoughts
- Reference earlier insights
- Show evolution of understanding
- Connect related concepts
- Identify emerging patterns
- Demonstrate learning
- Consider tool applications

2. Deepen Understanding
- Move from surface to depth
- Discover relationships
- Reveal patterns
- Form connections
- Generate insights
- Map to tool capabilities

3. Progress Toward Solutions
- Increase practicality
- Consider implementation
- Address constraints
- Plan concrete steps
- Verify feasibility
- Validate tool usage

THOUGHT PROGRESSION:

1. Connection to Previous
"Building on [previous insight about tool/concept]..."
"This relates to our understanding of [tool capability]..."
"This adds to our knowledge of [tool application]..."

2. New Understanding
"This reveals a way to use [tool]..."
"This suggests combining [tools]..."
"This indicates a better approach with [tool]..."

3. Evolution of Thinking
"This deeper analysis shows how [tool] could..."
"This more nuanced view suggests using [tool] to..."
"This refined understanding indicates [tool] would..."

ITERATION PATTERNS:

1. Deepening
- Surface -> Principles
- Symptoms -> Causes
- Effects -> Mechanisms
- Examples -> Patterns
- Tools -> Integrations

2. Broadening
- Single -> Multiple perspectives
- Isolated -> Connected concepts
- Individual -> Combined tools
- Simple -> Complex interactions
- Basic -> Advanced applications

3. Refinement
- Rough -> Precise understanding
- General -> Specific applications
- Basic -> Optimized tool usage
- Simple -> Sophisticated approaches
- Initial -> Refined solutions

INTEGRATION STRATEGIES:

1. Tool-Concept Mapping
- Match tools to concepts
- Identify tool synergies
- Plan tool sequences
- Consider tool limitations
- Optimize tool usage

2. Understanding Enhancement
- Use tools to explore
- Validate with tools
- Build on tool results
- Learn from tool usage
- Refine through tools

3. Solution Development
- Plan tool applications
- Sequence tool usage
- Validate approaches
- Test assumptions
- Verify feasibility

QUALITY INDICATORS:

1. Depth of Understanding
- Clear concept relationships
- Tool capability awareness
- Implementation readiness
- Constraint consideration
- Solution viability

2. Practical Progress

Remember:
- Each iteration should advance understanding
- Build on previous insights
- Consider tool capabilities
- Move toward implementation
- Show clear progression
- Validate approaches
- Plan concrete steps
